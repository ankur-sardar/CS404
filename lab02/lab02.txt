In this lab we added our names in repository.

In another experiment we read the switches and flashes the led from script and command line.

Later on  we installed fritznig in our systems.


we learnt to add our name in repo and cotrolling a led with the help of beagelbone.
 We also do some changes 
like blinking the leds simultaneously, pressing one switch blinks an LED 10 times and then stops.
