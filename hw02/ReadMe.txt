Sub: 4 leds controlling with the help of buttons and etch-a-sketch

So we controlled a 4 leds with the help of their respective buttons. 

We had make a program for etch-a-skect. The classic Etch足a足sketch has two knobs and a screen.  The knobs control the x

and y position of a pen on the screen.  Our simple Etch足a足sketch takes an input from the 

keyboard that tells the pen to move up, down, left, right.Our display is simply 

a grid of characters that show where the pen has been.
